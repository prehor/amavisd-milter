This is the CHANGELOG for amavisd-milter.

20190121:
	The milter socket is created before amavisd-milter is daemonized.
	This allows to return an error in case of impossibility to create
	the milter socket and package maintainers can adjust milter socket
	permissions immediatelly after the main process exits.

	Thanks to: Matus Uhlar

20190119:
	The Spamassassin's RDNS_NONE check tests if the rdns field in
	the Received header is empty or "unknown".  Postfix sets
	the {client_name} macro to "unknown" when the FcrDNS check
	fails, but the hostname passed to xxfi_connect is set to
	the IP address which means that RDNS_NONE is never triggered.
	Instead, use {client_name} macro, and only if it is not available
	use the hostname.

	New features:
	- Added new amavisd-milter option -q which sets milter socket backlog
	  used by listen(2).
	- Local state directory (default /var/amavis) is tunable via configure
	  option:
	  --localstatedir=</DIR>	      - absolute path to local state
	  					directory.
	- Working directory (default local state directory) is tunable via
	  configure option:
	  --with-working-directory=<SUBDIR>   - subdirectory of local
						state directory.
	  --with-working-directory=</DIR>     - absolute path to working
						directory.

	Bug and compatibility fixies:
	- amavisd-milter convert CRLF to LF in mail body to support amavisd-new
	  integrated DKIM signing and verification.
	- Fixed memory leak in fts_alloc() on Solaris.
	- Solaris doesn't have dirfd().
	- Solaris 9 and older doesn't have sem_timedwait.

20081109:

	option: --localstatedir=<DIR>

	Working directory (default local state directory) is tunable via
	configure option:

	used by listen(2).

20081029:
	Compatibility fix - Solaris 9 and older doesn't have sem_timedwait.

	Thans to: Henrik Krohns <hege@hege.li>

20081029:
	Memory leak in fts_alloc() on Solaris fixed.

	Luke Mewburn wrote:
	  In examining the code, it appears that the implementation of
	  fts_alloc() can leak the struct stat fts_statp if you're not using
	  ALIGNBYTES() && ALIGN(), which I guess that Solaris doesn't have.
	  Given that the leaked buffers are 160 bytes in size (184960/1156),
	  I suspect that's sizeof(struct stat) and our culprit.

	Thanks to: Henrik Krohns <hege@hege.li>
	Submitted by: Luke Mewburn <luke@mewburn.net>

20081028:
	Compatibility fix - Solaris doesn't have dirfd().

	Thanks to: Henrik Krohns <hege@hege.li>

20080701:
	Sync fts_open.c with the NetBSD libc (upstream) fts.c, which brought
	in a few fixes, including one that looked like a potential memory leak.
	Thanks to: Luke Mewburn <luke@mewburn.net>

	Properly check -D option parameters.
	Thanks to: Henrik K <hege@hege.li>

20080310:
	Convert CRLF to LF in mail body, because sendmail send always CRLF,
	but amavisd-new requires that a message on a temporary file is in
	a native text format of a host's file system, i.e. with LF terminated
	lines on Unix or Linux.
	Thanks to: David Schweikert <david@schweikert.ch> and Mark Martinec
	<Mark.Martinec@ijs.si>

20070923:
	amavisd-milter-1.3.1

	Bug fixies:
	- Properly calculate timezone offset for synthesized Received header
	  on platforms where gmtime() and localtime() returns the pointer to
	  the same static struct.

20070923:
	Better explained -D option.

20070915:
	In mlfi.c:mlfi_envfrom() the gmtime() and localtime() call returns the
	pointer to the same static struct.  Thus pointers gt and lt are
	identical and the UTC offset is always +0000 which is bogus.
	Thanks to: Curtis Doty <curtis@greenkey.net>

20070902:
	amavisd-milter-1.3.0

	New features:
	- Implemented AM.PDP request attribute policy_bank (amavisd-new
	  2.5.0 or higher is required).  Currently SMTP_AUTH, SMTP_AUTH_<MECH>
	  and SMTP_AUTH<MECH>_<BITS> policy bank names are sent when the remote
	  client is authenticated.
	- Added new amavisd-milter option -D client|server which allow
	  personalized header or body modifications.

	Bug fixies:
	- fixed bug when amavisd communication buffer is growing.

	Compatibility:
	- properly get queue id when amavisd-milter is used with postfix.

	Performance:
	- improved performance under heavy load.

20070901:
	Performance optimization: use sem_timedwait instead of
	sem_trywait+sleep(1) for amavisd connection lock.
	Requested by: David Schweikert <david@schweikert.ch>

20070831:
	Added new amavisd-milter option -D client|server which allow
	personalized header or body modifications.
	Requested by: Brian C. Huffman <bhuffman@graze.net>

	Fixed bug when amavisd communication buffer is growing.
	Thanks to: Michael Moeller <mmoeller@kimchukmail.com>

20070729:
	Better compatibility with Postfix: it does give information about
	the queue-number only after the RCPT-TO-phase.
	Thanks to: David Schweikert <david@schweikert.ch>

20061219:
	amavisd-milter-1.2.1

	New features:
	- Implemented AM.PDP request attribute 'protocol_name'.
	  Add folowing line to your sendmail.mc:

	  define(`confMILTER_MACROS_ENVFROM', confMILTER_MACROS_ENVFROM`, r, b')

	Limited support for sendmail 8.12:
	- smfi_addheader() is used instead of smfi_insheader() for insheader
	  and addheader AM.PDP responses. This works well with amavisd-new
	  2.4.3 or newer.
	- smfi_progress() isn't called when amavisd-milter wait for amavisd-new
	  communication socket.
	- AM.PDP response quarantine isn't implemented.

	Bug fixies:
	- add synthesized Received header for Spamassassin.
	- properly handle IPv6 client address.

20061217:
	Added support for IPv6 addresses.
	Thanks to: Mark Martinec <Mark.Martinec@ijs.si>

20061206:
	Limited support for legacy sendmail 8.12:
	- AM.PDP v2 response attribute quarantine isn't implemented.
	Thanks to: Adam Gibson <agibson@ptm.com>

20061203:
	Added info about user authentication to synthesized received header.
	Format of synthesized received header is now:

	Received: from <hello> (<rdns> [<ip>]) (authenticated bits=<bits>)
		by <hostname> (<rdns> [<ip>])
		with <protocol> (authenticated as <user>) id <qid>;
		<date>
		(envelope-from <sender>)

	Thanks to: Jo Rhett <jrhett@netconsonance.com>

20061113:
	Limited support for legacy sendmail 8.12:
	- amavisd-milter don't call smfi_progress when wait for amavisd-new
	  communication socket.
	- amavisd-milter use smfi_addheader instead of smfi_insheader for
	  insheader and addheader AM.PDP response attributes. This work well
	  with amavisd-new 2.4.3 or newer. Older versions are affected with
	  bug fixed on 20060714.

20061017:
	Implemented AM.PDP request attribute protocol_name.

	amavisd-milter adds Received header for the current connection to
	the mail file as the first line because without the most recent
	Received header, Spamassassin reports lots of false hits on rules
	checking where the message was received from.
	Thanks to: Jo Rhett <jrhett@netconsonance.com>

	NOTE: Please add these line to your sendmail.mc:

	define(`confMILTER_MACROS_ENVFROM', confMILTER_MACROS_ENVFROM`, r, b')


20061008:
	amavisd-milter-1.2.0

	Improved amavisd connection locking.  When amavisd connection is closed,
	lock is removed immediately.

20061004:
	Implemented AM.PDP protocol version 2.  New response attributes
	are version_server, insheader and quarantine.

	Tru64 portability fix: don't use variadic macros.

20060714:
	Fixed bug with addheader: amavisd-new assume that header is added
	to the end of headers but sendmail insert it before first occurence
	of the header with same name.
	Submitted by: Krzysztof Oledzki <ole@ans.pl>

20060616:
	Amavisd communication buffer is now dynamically allocated.
	MAXAMABUF is maximum buffer length, AMABUFCHUNK is initial length
	and reallocation step.  Buffer is allocated for every connection.

	Tru64 portability fix: replace missing daemon(8) function.

20060414:
	amavisd-milter-1.1.2

	MAXAMABUF is increased from 2048 to 65536 because it must be greater
	then confMAX_HEADERS_LENGTH which is usually set to 32768. If mail
	header is longer than MAXAMABUF, mail is permanently rejected with
	temporary fail return code and will never reach the recipents.

	Added new configure option --with-sendmail=<DIR> which change base
	directory in which are placed libmilter header files and library
	(e.q. /usr/local on FreeBSD when you using sendmail from ports).

20060125:
	amavisd-milter-1.1.1

	Portability release. amavisd-milter-1.1 now can be compiled on
	FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Linux and Solaris.  Please report
	success or problems on the users mailing list.

20060125:
	Linux and Solaris portability fix: sem_t is declared as pointer on
	*BSD but as structure on Linux and Solaris.

	Solaris portability fix: search sem_init in librt.

	Solaris portability fix: replace missing fts.h API.

20060124:
	amavisd-milter-1.1.0

	New features:
	- amavisd-milter can limit number of concurrent connections
	  to amavisd-new
	- amavisd-milter is responsible to remove message work
	  directory

20060124:
	README is now generated from amavisd-milter(8) manual page.

	Remove all files and directories in working directory because
	amavisd-new sometimes don't do it (e.q. when antivirus fail).

20060123:
	Limit maximum concurrent connections to amavisd:

	    amavisd-milter -m 4 -M 600

	means that there is limit to maximum 4 concurrent connections to
	amavisd and wait maximum 10 minutes (10*60 sec) for connection to
	amavisd.  When connection isn't available, amavisd-milter sleep for
	1 sec.  Every minute of waiting is sendmail triggered via
	smfi_progress.  When time limit run out then amvisd-milter return
	temporary fail.

20060113:
	amavisd-milter-1.0.4

	Bugfix release.  Added manual page amavisd-milter(8).

	INCOMPATIBILITY with 1.0.3 and previous versions:

	Default working directory was changed from /var/amavis/tmp
	to /var/amavis to accordance with amavisd-new $helpers_home
	default value.  To go back to the previous behaviour run
	amavisd-milter with option -w /var/amavis/tmp

20060109:
	When stopping amavisd-new one (maybe not always just one) of milter
	threads amavisd-milter start to eat up a cpu time.
	Submitted by: Grzegorz Piszczek <grzegorz@piszczek.name>

	Fixed bug in mlfi_close(): amavisd-milter dies randomly due to
	segmentation fault.
	Submitted by: Grzegorz Piszczek <grzegorz@piszczek.name>

20051225:
	Added amavisd-milter(8) manual page.  README and website are
	synchronized with this manual page.

	Changed default working directory to /var/amavis (default value
	for amavisd-new helpers home directory).

20051204:
	Some users reports problem with ENOMEM in amavis_response().
	Consequently MAXAMABUF is increased from 1024 to 2048, amavis_request()
	and amavis_response() returns EOVERFLOW when buffer size isn't enough
	and truncated response is logged when debug level is >= 3.

20051202:
	Fixed default path to pidfile in README and website.
	Submitted by: Jerzy Sakol <jerzy.sakol@commgraf.pl>

20050829:
	Added amavisd-new configuration section to README.

20050701:
	amavisd-milter-1.0.3

	Submitted by: Mr.Sompis Junsui <sompis.j@cdg.co.th>

20050701:
	Unlink old pid file on start.

20050605:

	FC3, OpenBSD 3.4 and Solaris 9.  Tested on Sourceforge compile farm.
	Please report success or problems on the users mailing list:

	http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/amavisd-milter-users

20050522:
	Define EILSEQ on systems without it.

20050520:
	mkdtemp(3) compatibility function.

20050512:
	Initial version of README.

20050512:
