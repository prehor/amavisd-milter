.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a sendmail milter (mail filter) for
.Sy amavisd-new
2.4.3 and above and
.Sy sendmail
8.13 and above (limited support for 8.12 is provided).
.Pp
Instead of older
.Sy amavis-milter
helper program, full
.Sy amavisd-new
functionality is available, including adding spam and virus information
header fields, modifying Subject, adding address extensions and removing
certain recipients from delivery while delivering the same message to
the rest.
.Pp

.Ss Options
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl B
Uses
.Sy {daemon_name}
macro as a policy bank name (see
.Sy POLICY BANKS
below).
.It Fl d Ar debug-level
Set the debug level to
.Sy debug-level Ns
\&.
Debugging traces become more verbose as the debug level increases.
Maximum is 9.
.It Fl D Ar delivery-care-of
Set AM.PDP request attribute delivery_care_of to
.Sy client
(default) or
.Sy server Ns
\&.  When
.Sy client
method is used then
.Nm
is responsible to forward the message to recipients. This method doesn't
allow personalized header or body modification.
.Pp
When
.Sy server
method is used then
.Sy amavisd-new
is responsible to forward the message to recipients and can provide
personalized header and body modification.
$forward_method in amavisd.conf must point to some place willing to accept
mail without further checking in
.Sy amavisd-new Ns
\&.
.It Fl f
Run
.Nm
in the foreground (i.e. do not daemonize).
Print debug messages to the terminal.
.It Fl h
Print help page and exit.
.It Fl m Ar max-conns
Maximum concurrent
.Sy amavisd
connections (default 0 - unlimited number of connections).
It must agree with the $max_servers entry in amavisd.conf.
.It Fl M Ar max-wait
Maximum wait for connection to
.Sy amavisd
in seconds (default 300 = 5 minutes).
It must be less then sending MTA timeout for a response to the final "."
that terminates a message on sending MTA.
.Sy sendmail
has default value 1 hour,
.Sy postfix
10 minutes and
.Sy qmail
20 minutes.
We suggest to use less than 10 minutes.
.It Fl p Ar pidfile
Use this pid file (default /var/amavis/amavisd-milter.pid).
.It Fl P
When
.Sy amavisd-new
fails mail will be passed through unchecked.
.It Fl q Ar backlog
Sets the incoming socket backlog used by
.Xr listen 2 Ns
\&.
If it is not set or set to zero, the operating system default is used.
.It Fl s Ar socket
Communication socket between
.Sy sendmail
and
.Nm
(default /var/amavis/amavisd-milter.sock).
The protocol spoken over this socket is
.Sy MILTER
(Mail FILTER).
It must agree with the INPUT_MAIL_FILTER entry in sendmail.mc
.Pp
The
.Ar socket
should be in "proto:address" format:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
.Sy {unix|local}:/path/to/file
- A named pipe.
.It
.Sy inet:port@{hostname|ip-address}
- An IPV4 socket.
.It
.Sy inet6:port@{hostname|ip-address}
- An IPV6 socket.
.El
.It Fl S Ar socket
Communication socket between
.Nm
and
.Sy amavisd-new
(default /var/amavis/amavisd.sock).
The protocol spoken over this socket is
.Sy AM.PDP
(AMavis Policy Delegation Protocol).
It must agree with the $unix_socketname entry in amavisd.conf.
.Pp
The
.Ar socket
should be in "proto:address" format:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
.Sy {unix|local}:/path/to/file
- A named pipe.
.El
.It Fl t Ar timeout
.Sy sendmail
connection timeout in seconds (default 600 = 10 minutes).
It must agree with the INPUT_MAIL_FILTER entry in sendmail.mc and must be
greater than or equal to the
.Sy amavisd-new
connection timeout.
When you use other milters (especially time-consuming), the timeout must be
sufficient to process message in all milters.
.It Fl T Ar timeout
.Sy amavisd-new
connection timeout in seconds (default 600 = 10 minutes).
This timeout must be sufficient for message processing in
.Sy amavisd-new Ns
\&.
It's usually a good idea to adjust them to the same value as
.Sy sendmail
connection timeout.
.It Fl v
Report the version number and exit.
.It Fl w Ar directory
Set working directory (default /var/amavis).
.El
.Ss Limited support for sendmail 8.12
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
.Fn smfi_addheader
is used instead of
.Fn smfi_insheader
for
.Li insheader
and
.Li addheader
AM.PDP responses. This works well with
.Sy amavisd-new
2.4.3 or newer.
.It
.Fn smfi_progress
isn't called when
.Sy amavisd-milter
wait for
.Sy amavisd-new
communication socket.
.It
AM.PDP response
.Li quarantine
isn't implemented.
.El
.Pp
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Em /var/amavis/amavisd-milter.pid
The default process-id file.
.It Em /var/amavis/amavisd-milter.sock
The default
.Sy sendmail
communication socket.
.It Em /var/amavis/amavisd.sock
The default
.Sy amavisd-new
communication socket.
.It Em /var/amavis
The default working directory.
.El
.Sh POLICY BANKS
If the option
.Sy -B
is enabled,
.Nm
uses the value of the milter macro
.Sy {daemon_name}
as a name of the
.Sy amavisd-new
policy bank. Usualy this milter macro is set to name of the MTA.
.Pp
When remote client is authenticated,
.Nm
uses this information as a name of the
.Sy amavisd-new
policy banks:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Sy SMTP_AUTH
Indicate that the remote client is authenticated.
.It Sy SMTP_AUTH_<MECH>
Remote client authentication mechanism.
.It Sy SMTP_AUTH_<MECH>_<BITS>
The number of bits used for the key of the symmetric cipher when
authentication mechanism use it.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss Configuring amavisd-new
In amavisd.conf file change protocol and socket settings to:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$protocol = "AM.PDP";                      # Use AM.PDP protocol
$unix_socketname = "$MYHOME/amavisd.sock"; # Listen on Unix socket
### $inet_socket_port = 10024;             # Don't listen on TCP port
.Ed
.Pp
Then (re)start amavisd daemon.
.Ss Configuring sendmail
To the sendmail.mc file add the following entries:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
define(`confMILTER_MACROS_CONNECT',
	confMILTER_MACROS_CONNECT`, {client_resolve}')
define(`confMILTER_MACROS_ENVFROM',
	confMILTER_MACROS_ENVFROM`, r, b')
INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`amavisd-milter',
	`S=local:/var/amavis/amavisd-milter.sock,
	F=T, T=S:10m;R:10m;E:10m')
.Ed
.Pp
Then rebuild your sendmail.cf file, install it (usually to
/etc/mail/sendmail.cf) and (re)start sendmail daemon.
.Ss Running Nm
This example assume that
.Sy amavisd-new
is running as user
.Sy amavis Ns
\&.
It must agree with the entry $daemon_user in amavisd.conf.
.Pp
First create working directory:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mkdir /var/amavis/tmp
chmod 750 /var/amavis/tmp
chown amavis /var/amavis/tmp
.Ed
.Pp
Then start
.Nm
as non-priviledged user amavis:
.Pp
.Dl su - amavis -c \&" Ns Nm Fl w Ar /var/amavis/tmp Ns \&"
.Ss Limiting maximum concurrent connections to amavisd
To limit concurrent connections to 4 and fail after 10 minutes
(10*60 secs) of waiting run
.Nm
with this options:
.Pp
.Dl su - amavis -c \&" Ns Nm Fl w Ar /var/amavis/tmp Fl m Ar 4 Fl M Ar 600 Ns \&"
.Ss Troubleshooting
For troubleshooting run
.Nm
on the foreground and set debug level to appropriate level:
.Pp
.Dl su - amavis -c \&" Ns Nm Fl w Ar /var/amavis/tmp Fl f Fl d Ar level Ns \&"
.Pp
where debug levels are:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXX"
.It 1
Not errors but unexpected states (connection abort etc).
.It 2
Main states in message processing.
.It 3
All
.Nm
debug messages.
.It 4-9
Milter communication debugging (smfi_setdbg 1-6).
